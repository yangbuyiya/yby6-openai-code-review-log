It looks like you're showing a diff output for a Java file, specifically `GoodsReceiveApplyServiceImpl.java`. In this diff, there's a modification that changes the case statement handling for a workflow node in a switch-case structure. Hereâ€™s a clearer breakdown of the change:

### Original Code:
```java
-                case "Node2":
```

### New Code:
```java
+                case "Node3":
```

### Context:
- This code is likely part of a workflow management system where different nodes represent different processing states or steps.
- This change indicates that the case for "Node2" was replaced with "Node3". 

### Consequences:
- If "Node2" was handling a certain workflow process, that handling will no longer occur, and instead, the handling for "Node3" will be executed when that case is hit in the switch statement.
- The specifics of how the workflow changes would depend on the implementation details of `WorkFlowUtils.buildFlow()` and how "node1", "node2", and "node3" relate to the overall workflow process.

### Suggested Next Steps:
1. Ensure that "Node3" is properly defined and that its behavior matches the intended functionality.
2. Test the functionality to confirm that the workflow operates as expected after this change.
3. Check documentation or comments surrounding this section of code to ensure that the change aligns with overall project goals.
